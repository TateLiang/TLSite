The city demands a transitional scale, an urban connectivity and reimagined centrality amid increasing density that can characterize the uncertain identity of its surroundings. Extra Large answers by inheriting a native pedestrian level that accepts its row house, high-rise, highway and park context, and transforms them in an aggregated urbanism of its own. At the same time its conviction is as potent as what it leaves behind—the triangular form is resultant from an opening of unexpected visual and pedestrian corridors.<br><br>Why does it have to be Extra Large? An era of certainty allowed the use of eminent domain to perform out-of-scale interventions, could it take the same confidence to reconstitute the parts left behind? Through layered program and moments of interpenetration, Extra Large collapses different user groups to a programmatic composite, in a sectional gradient from public to private. Imposition from the top down transitions to a delicacy at the ground level as it meets the city’s piecemeal fabric. Extreme scale in plan attracts external forces into a continuous exchange with its own culture, both as an urban band-aid and as a catalyst for the unpredictable.<br><br>Striated housing to the south extends through matching rows of a market typology, terminating into an open public outdoor activity space on the east. Eight sets of public stairs and ramps bring pedestrians to this entirely open and elevated layer, bridging the submerged I-90 highway and two side roads to unite two divided Boston communities. The west face includes a green buffer zone to the street and a balcony providing seating and accessibility to storefronts. On the east, a large entrance stair leading stepwise to a roof landscape is also available as a public venue. Within the market are permanent and temporary stalls, seating areas and other amenities that can serve multipurpose large-span functions.<br><br>An institution layer lies above, supported by a vaulted structure system that accommodates a free plan studio configuration. Classrooms, labs, breakout booths, a library and auditorium populate the institution as it expands to assume an entirely interior urbanism. Large openings to below and regular skylights at each column bring natural light to the market and ground levels. A semi-public panoramic landscape above the institution creates a sublime contrast to the Boston skyline and invents a “contained escape” from the city. And as a new flexible surface datum, Extra Large becomes a podium to support additional housing expansion above.";

There is a raw realness from the utilization of every square inch to its fullest potential. The small space asks a unique question of perspective: paradoxically the smaller a space, the less of it can be seen at once, thus transforming our modes of perception into critical instruments of design.<br><br>By confronting the spaces that pose the greatest limitations to our movement we understand how architecture reconfigures living from those very limitations. The scale at which the body cannot be simplified into generic dimensions will inform a more considered approach to scales where it can.<br><br>The impossibility of a micro-home imprisons of the body, appearing vulgar and beneath consideration of traditional formal theory. For the condensed mode of living that pursues extreme performance, its organization occupies overlapping and irrational proximities in space, between tables that fold away to fit the bed to storage hidden behind other layers of cabinetry. The orthographic mode of projection used to design these spaces fail to describe them post-occupancy. Traditional techniques of plan and section do not suffice to articulate the complexities of a space that wraps in on itself.<br><br>Two models are displayed with a two-way mirror between: one model is the room as the architect sees it: pristine, precise and absolute. On the other side is the room as it is lived in post-occupancy. While both describe the same space, they have radically different readings. The reflection of one model is superimposed on the mirror with the other model, by using the same angles between the mirror and observer.<br><br>Architects are perpetually concerned with the constant calibration of their world in an attempt to understand it all. In fear of an unsavoury association with aesthetics architects are often concerned by the geometric and mathematical buttresses that hold up their ideology. The methods of measuring and reproduction constitute a theory of representation that places the depiction of a space at the same or greater importance as the space itself.<br><br>Unlike the symmetrical spaces of the Renaissance whose doctrine imports the logics of perspective, the micro-home is a typology inseparable from the body and can only be viewed through perspective. It is unfortunately always too close to the subject to be codified in orthographic projection, and the micro-home never exists without a subject—it is always understood in the terms of how one fits within it. Because of the asymmetry of focus within the micro-home that denies enumeration, it becomes a space of irrationality: it cannot be compressed any further without losing information, defining itself as the fundamental unit of living.<br><br>There is already a ubiquitous interpolation between real and perceived space within every home: the computer screen. It is what allows us to stay within the same 200 square foot room all day, what necessitates the repurposing of the bedroom once meant only for sleeping into the “everything” room. I made an interactive installation to question this new production of space. It’s a little hard to show through pictures, but a camera is pointed at the observer, which is connected to a face tracking script. This information is passed into Unreal Engine, where it changes the location of the scene’s camera in order to match the perspective of the viewer, creating a parallax effect where the render scene appears to be real, behind the projected screen.";

This balance holds a space for meditation between ground and sky. Openings folded into the roof and soft depressions imprinted into earth reinterprets the separation of traditional monastic typologies by replacing rigid planimetric walls with sectional compression and expansion. The result is an equilibrium at the intersection of vertical forces and the sweeping horizon. <br><br>Approaching the building begins by a descent from the surrounding landscape of Freshkills park into a recessed garden containing the circular path for chanting. On the inside, spaces of meditation and rest are informally separated from gathering and dining. Each area captures the sun at different times throughout the day through the size and orientation of skylights, corresponding to the rituals of monks.<br><br>Perimeter panels can be opened to peak over the horizon or closed to focus.

And we must also consider how to define an entirely new urbanism—the urbanism of speed. As the impeccable marketing for the post-industrial phenomenon of personal mobility produces increasing isolation, we might be faced with an ideology where once more, we just need to go faster. <br><br>The new dogmatism of speed believes the urban failures of continuous movement can be reprimanded precisely by enhancing them; shrinking the half-hour commute into two minutes produces a city entirely unrecognizable in character, population and distribution. Speed solidifies the architectural impulse, which collages the city as instantaneous snapshots of decentralized but also highly personal thought. The perpetual urban dilemma of density becomes irrelevant, when suddenly the space between cities collapse by virtually instant connections. The city will be a global and singular mosaic of situations. <br><br>When our traditional measures of space and distance are disrupted beyond repair, this version of the city will constitute a formal divorce between structure and image. This disruption will render navigation from a top down map obsolete, and with it the conventional notions of ground, locale and public space lose their urban expression.<br><br>In this imaginary dystopia, high-speed rail becomes the primary device for transportation, replacing a tiered separation of travel with only two speeds: by train and by foot. This speed elicits a dichotomous society, one on the network and one outside. When all goods, labour and exchanges are connected and distributed from one source, the network will become the new medium of opportunity as well as oppression. The network is a Potemkin society only revealing its most attractive facades of urban life, one where long distances and the separate class that must maintain the network becomes invisible. Two kinds of nodes will emerge: Discrete locations of interest with specific conditions, resources and existing utility, and entirely artificial points that develop simply as hubs between other nodes. These new intersectional cities will be the new way that cities grow: inward rather than outward. <br><br>By means of instantaneous connection each city will be part of a larger whole, and the occupation of the city, traditional heterogenous, might then turn specialized; where speed is king, zoning has no consequences. Real estate will be in a constant competition between every single other lot on the network. There may finally be an opportunity for the architect at the critical points of this system—the station. As the station becomes the only moment important enough for intervention, and the effects of an intervention become exponentially multiplied at these singularities, perhaps in this respite only architecture can introduce an artificial slowness, a short walk from platform to platform, or a piece of identity un-blurring some hidden authenticity of travel, holding us back from endless acceleration."

Beginning with a collage-montage of public voids within the building envelope mass, the design evolved through sculpting the connected voids as a figure absorbing the roles of entrance, circulation, communal space skylight. Rooms acting as infilled poche are discretized by a vertical seam, resulting in public amenities and a private hotel, programmatically separated yet spatially interlocked.

If summer is the invitation to shed layers, can a living structure itself change clothes, moods and lifestyles? Against restrictive environments, we propose a space of limitless possibility for any living condition. To the opposing aims of domestic comfort and a candid confrontation with nature, we create a double skin, revealing architecture and conditioning systems as mediators for light, temperature, and survival. A thermal buffer zone between nested glass volumes provides space for changing temperatures and new activities, such as taking a hot bath with a snowy backdrop. An operable insulation layer can open to reveal a panoramic view, and close to reduce heating load, but critically also creates an artificial night in a region of eternal day.

Flawless extremes have been sieved to reveal alleged fundamentals and to establish precedents on which to define the basis for imagination. Perhaps innumerable histories of what not to do have fooled us into believing that its aggregate antithesis is utopia itself.<br><br>Discourse on the city today occupies a precarious compromise where it can neither imagine a radical restructuring nor fully placate itself through autonomous function.

Through Plato to the renaissance, modernist idealisms to subsequent critical responses, each assert a criteria for interpreting the city. Debate with the assumption of a continuous “progress” under those criteria necessarily also acknowledges a hypothetical end condition. Whether a revision of what came before, or an earnest advocacy ofnew inevitabilities, urban theory reluctantly approaches utopia of its own definition.<br><br>Our appetite finds its only satiation in a framework that cannot by any means be further perfected; the better city is automatically enticing, so the “best” is irresistible. Architects find relevance in the persuasiveness of ideals in admission of their ineffectiveness and inapplicability on the large scale. If we accept the premise, however narrow, of a specific ideology and bring it to absurdity, we reveal a blind perfection describing a hilarious outcome— the superlative. Their absolute peculiarities reveal limits underpinning the nature of experience, perhaps even articulating some bounded certainty where the absurd becomes rationale.
